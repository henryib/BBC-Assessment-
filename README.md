# BBC-Assessment

## My approach 

> Rather than use unit tests to test functionaity i chose to create a working program that allows the user to play by extending the play class


## Assumptions 
 > A blackjack game with only 1 player and the dealer is possible 
 > The dealer can only hit until within the range: 17 - 21 (General rule of blackjack)
